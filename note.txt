After I finished the JavaScript book "JavaScript from Beginner to Professional," I spent some time writing this mini project:

I created an input box where you can enter your age. Then, the project will show you your age on different planets in our galaxy.

Here is how the project works:

    The user enters their age in the input box.
    The project calculates the user's age on different planets in our galaxy.
    The project displays the user's age on the different planets.

The project uses the following JavaScript functions:

   functions, Arrow Fucntions/ subString(), and parseFloat(), toFixed() methods.
   And also i used addEventListener() To target the user input.

The project also uses some HTML and CSS code:
 simple HTML Structure and Css Styling and animations and media queries for responsive purposes

I hope you enjoy this  project.
